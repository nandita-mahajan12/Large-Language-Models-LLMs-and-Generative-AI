Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI
Tasks

Task 1: Explore LLMs  
Explore Hugging Face and list five different Large Language Models along with their use cases.

Example models include GPT-style models for text generation, BERT-based models for classification, and instruction-tuned models for chat applications.

Task 2: Text Generation using Transformers  
Use Hugging Face pipelines to generate text from a prompt using transformer-based models.

Task 3: Text Generation using Free API  
Create a Python program that uses any free-tier text generation API to generate text responses.

Task 4: Prompt Templates  
Design a prompt template and test multiple prompt variations using the same language model to observe output differences.

Task 5: Conversational AI Program  
Create a Python program that takes user input and provides AI responses in a conversational flow, maintaining context between turns.

Task 6: Multimodal Generation  
Generate both text and images using two different tools, such as an open-source text generation model and an image generation model (for example, Gemini or Stable Diffusion).
